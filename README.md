# Unexpected Behavior in add Function with Non-Numeric Input

This repository demonstrates a common error in DApps: the lack of input validation. The `add` function is intended to add two numbers, but it doesn't handle cases where the input isn't a number.

## Bug Description
The `add` function lacks input validation, leading to unexpected results or errors when non-numeric values are passed as arguments.  This can lead to vulnerabilities and incorrect application behavior.
